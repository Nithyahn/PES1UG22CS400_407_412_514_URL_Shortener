# PES1UG22CS400_407_412_514_URL_Shortener
**Problem Statement**
Create a containerized URL shortener service that accepts long URLs and generates shortened ones. The service should be scalable using Docker and Kubernetes, with a load balancer distributing requests across multiple instances. URL data should be stored in an in-memory key-value store running in a separate container.
